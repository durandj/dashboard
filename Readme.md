# Dashboard

Dashboard is a Chrome application that is meant to provide a more interesting home page for your browser.

## Building

Dashboard uses Grunt to compile the Chrome package. Make sure you have `grunt-cli` installed. Bower is also
used for dependency management with the actual application so you'll need to do a `bower install` to get all
the required dependencies.
